Here are a few things I wrote because I needed them, and shared because other people may need them too.

## svg_to_ico

[GitHub](https://github.com/Ortham/svg_to_ico)

As the name suggests, a CLI utility and Rust library for converting an SVG file into an ICO file. I use it to generate icons for LOOT's and Yore's executables.

## Pseudosem

[GitHub](https://github.com/Ortham/pseudosem)

A C++11 header-only library for comparison of version strings, following the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) specification and featuring support for a wider variety of version syntaxes.

## Jed Gettext Parser

[GitHub](https://github.com/Ortham/jed-gettext-parser)

A Javascript Gettext MO file parser that outputs [Jed](https://slexaxton.github.io/Jed/)-compatible data, and which can be run in browser and Node environments.

## MARS

[GitHub](https://github.com/Ortham/mars)

<div class="table-row">
    <img alt="MARS icon" src="images/MARS.svg"><p>An interface for the Agilent B2900A Precision SMU that allows the automated testing of devices over time.<br>
    So named because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity_(rover)">Curiosity</a> landed as I wrote it.</p>
