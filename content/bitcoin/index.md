Please don't send me Bitcoin! If you want to donate, consider doing so through
PayPal. If you can't or don't want to use PayPal, an email saying something nice
is *at least* as effective a way to show your appreciation. Links to my PayPal
page and email address are at the bottom of the page.

I've kept this page up as it's referenced elsewhere, and as an acknowledgement
that I do still own the address below.

My Bitcoin address as a `bitcoin:` URI, QR code and plain text is available
below.

If you're interested in trying out Bitcoin, but don't know how to get started,
my  [blog post]({{< ref "2014-09-12-donating-with-bitcoin" >}}) may be of
interest to you.
