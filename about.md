I like to solve problems with code. Most of my published code is written in C++, but I like JavaScript and Python too. I'm a big fan of HTML5-based user interfaces.

I've also made or helped make a number of mods for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and written some articles about modding on Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas, some of which can be found here.

*WrinklyNinja* is my preferred pseudonym on the Internet. I got it from the last line of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2jDTufS5WY) Orange advert, which for some reason stuck in my mind.

When I'm not writing code, I like to chip away at the vast backlog of games that starts with my Steam library, listen to music, go for a run (one day I shall casually run a 5k...), or read (more screen than paper, these days).
